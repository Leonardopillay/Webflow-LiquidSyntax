## CSV to Webflow CMS JSON Converter

The CSV to JSON converter is a powerful tool that saves you time and effort when importing content into Webflow. This tool allows you to take bulk data in CSV format and convert it to the JSON structure that Webflow requires.

### Features of the Converter

- **Error Handling**: The tool provides clear error messages if the CSV format is incorrect.
- **Custom Mapping**: Map your CSV columns to Webflow fields easily.

### Example Usage

To convert a CSV file, run the following command:

```bash
node cli/convert.js path/to/your/file.csv
```

The output will be a JSON file ready for import into Webflow.
